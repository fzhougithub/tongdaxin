to load the schema, login to mongosh
use stock
load('/var/tellme/work/cronus/tongdaxin/schema/stockhistory')

or, you can directly load using eval option with mongosh

mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017/stock" -eval "source('/var/tellme/work/cronus/tongdaxin/schema/stockhistory_presplit')"

But, with the mongodb 6, the splitVector method, manually split chunk, are not allowed.
